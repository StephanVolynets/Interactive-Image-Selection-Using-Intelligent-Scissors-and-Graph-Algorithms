*This project is a graphical image editing application developed as part of the CS 2110 course, where I implemented the "intelligent scissors" algorithm to automatically trace image edges. The application allows users to interactively select areas in an image by combining manual point-to-point selection with automated edge-following based on graph theory and shortest-path algorithms.*
