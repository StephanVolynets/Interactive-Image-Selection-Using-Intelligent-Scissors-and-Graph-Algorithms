## Verification questions

1. Approximately how much faster does your app finish processing the clocktower
   image when using your `HeapMinQueue` vs. the `RefMinQueue`?  (with assertions
   disabled)

   Answer: Much faster, at least a second.

## Reflection questions

1. When completing A5, did you make any assumptions specific to point-to-point
   selections that you had to relax or fix in order to work with A6's new
   selection model?  What do you think would be a good technique to help
   developers avoid assuming things beyond what's specified in an interface?

   Answer: n A5, I may have assumed start and end points were on the same object,
   which doesn't hold for A6's region selection model. To avoid assumptions beyond the interface,
   thoroughly read documentation, test edge cases, and write unit tests that can catch these
   assumptions.

2. Describe your custom weigher(s) and what inspired you to do the calculations
   that you did.

   Answer: My LuminanceGradientWeigher considers pixel luminance (weighted sum of RGB)
    instead of just grayscale intensity, to better handle images with different colors
    but similar brightness levels. The inspiration for this weigher came from the fact that
    the CrossGradMonoWeight weigher, which uses only the grayscale intensity, may not work well
    for images with different colors that have similar brightness levels.

3. What is your favorite thing you learned or accomplished in CS 2110?

   Answer:
   My favorite things learned were OOP principles like encapsulation and design patterns,
   as well as algorithms and data structures. Implementing the Intelligent Scissors algorithm,
   understanding it, and seeing it work was a proud accomplishment.
